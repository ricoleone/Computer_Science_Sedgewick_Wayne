 * Name:
 * Usage:
 * Description: that takes two integer command-line arguments n and 
 * trials and performs the following experiment, trials times:
 * - Choose a birthday for the next person, uniformly at random between 
 *   0 and n âˆ’ 1.
 * - Have that person enter the room.
 * - If that person shares a birthday with someone else in the room, 
 *   stop; otherwise repeat. 
 * In each experiment, count the number of people that enter the room. 
 * Print a table that summarizes the results (the count i, the number 
 * of times that exactly i people enter the room, and the fraction of 
 * times that i or fewer people enter the room) for each possible value
 * of i from 1 until the fraction reaches (or exceeds) 50%.
